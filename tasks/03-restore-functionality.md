# Task 3: Restore Functionality After Server Component Conversion

## Objective
After converting the products page to use Server Components, restore all interactive functionality while maintaining the performance benefits of Server Components.

## Current State
- Products page is now a Server Component
- Data fetching happens on the server
- Interactive features (cart, buttons) are broken

## Requirements
1. Create Client Components for interactive elements
2. Restore cart functionality
3. Restore "Add to Cart" functionality
4. Maintain server-side data fetching benefits
5. Keep the UI responsive and interactive
6. Ensure immediate button responsiveness with loading states

## Steps
1. Create Client Components:
   - Create `CartButton.tsx` for the add to cart functionality
   - Create `Cart.tsx` for the shopping cart display
   - Create `ProductCard.tsx` for individual product displays with interactions

2. Implement Cart State Management:
   - Use React Context or a state management solution
   - Keep cart state in a Client Component
   - Ensure cart persists across page navigation
   - Implement optimistic updates for better UX

3. Restore Interactive Features:
   - Add onClick handlers in Client Components
   - Implement cart add/remove functionality
   - Restore quantity controls
   - Add loading states for interactions
   - Make buttons immediately responsive with loading indicators
   - Use optimistic updates for cart operations
   - Show loading spinners or disabled states during server actions

4. Optimize Performance:
   - Use proper component boundaries
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Keep server-side data fetching
   - Minimize client-side JavaScript
   - Use optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance

## Expected Outcome
- All interactive features working as before
- Maintained server-side rendering benefits
- Smooth user experience
- Proper loading states during interactions
- Immediate button responsiveness
- Clear visual feedback during server actions
- Optimistic updates for better perceived performance

## Tips
- Use 'use client' directive only where needed
- Keep state management close to where it's used
- Use React Context for global state if needed
- Consider using React Suspense for loading states
- Test all interactive features thoroughly
- Implement loading spinners or disabled states for buttons during server actions
- Use optimistic updates to show changes immediately while waiting for server confirmation
- Consider using React's useTransition for smoother loading states
